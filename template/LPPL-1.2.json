This license may\nbe particularly suitable if your program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it\neven if your program is unrelated to TeX. The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER\nTHIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are\nconsidering distributing their programs under this license.\nIn this license document, `The Program' refers to any program distributed under this license.\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed and conditions under which\nmodified versions of The Program may be distributed. Individual files of The Program may bear\nsupplementary and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of\nmodified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The Program may bear supplementary or superseding\nconditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file. A distributor wishing to distribute\na complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this\nlicense and nowhere else.\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program are not covered by this license;\nthey are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute\nmodified versions of The Program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to\nachieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' in the\nbase LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program. Distribution of only part of The Program\nis not allowed.\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of\nthat file.\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met:\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "1."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified\nversion of the file as described below in the subsection `Additional Conditions on\nIndividual Files of The Program'.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "2."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nIf the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions\non the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the\nsubsection `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "3."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "4."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nIn the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and\nthe name (if any) of the program which contains it.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "5."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified\nfile is not part of The Program.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "6."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or\nin The Program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the\noriginal maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "7."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the\nmodified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the\noriginal file.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "8."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou must do either (A) or (B):\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "(A)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\ndistribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete, unmodified copy of The Program)\ntogether with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by\noffering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering\nequivalent access to copy The Program from the same place meets this condition, even\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the modified\nfile;\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "(B)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nprovide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to\nobtain a copy of The Program; for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator\n(URL) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of The Program free of\ncharge (either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later\nversion).\nNote that in the above, `distribution' of a file means making the file available to\nothers by any means. This includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine\nin such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself.\n`Modification' of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file\nunder any applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or a\nsignificant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\ninto another language.\nChanging the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file conventions of the\ntarget file systems) is considered to be a modification of the file.\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have\nbeen modified in accordance with the above conditions. Note, however, that Condition\n7. does apply to any such modified file.\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the\nupdating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version\nof that file of The Program.\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own personal use, without\nalso meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file. While you\nmight intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will\nhappen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not\noccur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus\ndistributing it and violating the conditions of this license. It is usually in your\nbest interest to keep your copy of The Program identical with the public one. Many\nprograms provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its\nlicensed files.\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that supplement and/or\nsupersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions\nexclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of\nthe file. The conditions on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only\nwith respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed,\nand with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files.\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n---------------------------------------------\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is, if it is a LaTeX\nsoftware file), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and/or\nsupersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename\nextension:\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "-"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins' since these are installation\nfiles containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "-"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.fd' (LaTeX font\ndefinition files) under the standard conditions of the LPPL as described above. You may\nalso distribute such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\nprovided that:\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "(1)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nthe only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent\nattempts to access unavailable fonts;\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "(2)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nyou also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input paths can be used to\ncontrol which set of LaTeX font definition files is actually used by TeX).\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "-"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nYou may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `.cfg'\n(configuration files) with their original names. The Program may (and usually will)\nspecify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the\ndistribution of modified versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code\nfor them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\nThere is no warranty for The Program. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder\nprovides The Program `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,\nincluding, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular\npurpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of The Program is with you. Should The\nProgram prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the files of\nThe Program, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted above, be\nliable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising\nout of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to,\nloss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure\nof The Program to operate with any other programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or\nsaid other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n=========================================================\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are\nconsidering distributing their programs under this license. These authors are addressed as `you'\nin this section.\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ from those\nin this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute\nyour program under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own\nlicense, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your\nprogram is distributed under the LPPL.\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the\nconditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General\nPublic License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your program is unrelated to LaTeX, the\ndiscussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their\nprograms under any license are encouraged to read it.\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice\nincluding your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the\nfile is constrained by the conditions in this license.\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n"}, {"type": "optional", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "%%"}]}, {"type": "text", "content": " "}, {"type": "var", "name": "filename", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "pig.dtx"}], "pattern": ".+"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n"}, {"type": "optional", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "%%"}]}, {"type": "text", "content": " Copyright "}, {"type": "var", "name": "copyright", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "2001 M. Y.

Y. Name'.\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\nDefining What Constitutes The Program\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the files of The Program. It is therefore\nimportant that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\nThis could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of The Program near the\ncopyright notice of each file or by using a line like\n% This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine\nwhat is considered by you to comprise The Program.\nNoting Exceptional Files If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification,\nor on distribution of modified versions, of those files (other than those listed in `Additional\nConditions on LaTeX Software Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a prominent\nfile that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or\nmore categories of exceptional files.\nFiles containing the text of a license (such as this file) are often examples of files bearing more\nrestrictive conditions on modification. LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\n`.cfg') are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a\nmodified version of the file. The additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples of\ndeclaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions.\n"}]
