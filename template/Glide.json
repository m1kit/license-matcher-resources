Some of these licenses require that, as a\ncondition of the license of the software, any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work\ncontaining the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general use, without\nrestriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that the source code for such derivative works\nmust likewise be made available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be subject to\nthe same General Public License terms as the original work.\nThis 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the standard licenses of this type in\nthat it does not require the entire derivative work to be made available under the terms of this\nlicense nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for the entire derivative\nwork. Rather, the license is limited to only the identifiable portion of the derivative work that is\nderived from the licensed software.
