But I did not\n           mean them to last as long as they did.\n\n         \nSo, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N >= 3) version string for future xinetd versions that you\n           release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that would only create confusion. Naming the\n           next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.\n\n    "}]
