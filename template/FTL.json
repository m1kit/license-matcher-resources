The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and\n         makefiles, at the very least.\n\n          \nThis license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all\n         encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike.
