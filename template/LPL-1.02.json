The obligations in this section do not apply to\nany claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In\norder to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nDistributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and\ncooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own\nexpense.\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.\nThat Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor.
