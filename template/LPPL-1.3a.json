If you do not see how to\nachieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and\n`modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n`Work' Any work being distributed under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any\napplicable law is derived from the Work.\n`Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example,\nthe production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion\nof such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law.\n`Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in\npart. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work\naccessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's\nNetwork File System (NFS).\n`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly\nusable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the\nWork, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that\nmodification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the\nWork.\n`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such\nexplicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.\n`Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part\nor the whole of the Work. A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not\nconsidered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies\nitself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the\nWork, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a \"LaTeX-Format\".\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "1."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this\nlicense; they are outside its scope.

You should also announce\nyour new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are\nconsidering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly\nfrom those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\ndistribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for\nyour own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the\nconditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General\nPublic License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the\ndiscussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their\nworks under any license are encouraged to read it.\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting\nthe above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you\nhave modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that\ncould have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in\nyour best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide\nways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components.\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice\nincluding your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include\nalso a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the\nconditions in this license.\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n"}, {"tag": "optional", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "%%"}]}, {"tag": "text", "content": " "}, {"tag": "var", "name": "filename", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "pig.dtx"}], "pattern": ".+"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\n"}, {"tag": "optional", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "%%"}]}, {"tag": "text", "content": " Copyright "}, {"tag": "var", "name": "copyright", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "2003 M.

Y. Name'.\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change \"maintained\"\nabove into \"author-maintained\". However, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as\nthe Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community\neven when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\nDefining What Constitutes the Work\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore\nimportant that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This\ncould, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright\nnotice of each file or by using a line such as:\n% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine\nwhat is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to\nmake reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.\n"}]
