By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software\nand to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other\nFree Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\nthe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the\nsoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\ncertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\nthis free software. If the software is modified by someone else\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\nhave is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program\nwill individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent\nmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "termsTitle", "content": [], "pattern": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE|"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.
