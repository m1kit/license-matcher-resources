Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its\ncopyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above\ncopyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation;\nprincipally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for\nfull details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG\ncode, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by\nthe Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts\n(config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by\nM.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM,\nAT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more\nlicenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\n(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is\nunlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent\nrestrictions on the remaining code.\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the\nUnisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been\nsimplified to produce \"uncompressed GIFs\". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;\nthe resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\nWe are required to state that\n\"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.\nGIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.\"\n"}]
