In this preface, design information is called\n\"documentation\" and things created from it are called \"products.\"\nThe TAPR Open Hardware License (\"OHL\") agreement provides a legal\nframework for Open Hardware projects. It may be used for any kind of\nproduct, be it a hammer or a computer motherboard, and is TAPR's\ncontribution to the community; anyone may use the OHL for their Open\nHardware project.\nLike the GNU General Public License, the OHL is designed to guarantee\nyour freedom to share and to create. It forbids anyone who receives\nrights under the OHL to deny any other licensee those same rights to\ncopy, modify, and distribute documentation, and to make, use and\ndistribute products based on that documentation.\nUnlike the GPL, the OHL is not primarily a copyright license. While\ncopyright protects documentation from unauthorized copying, modification,\nand distribution, it has little to do with your right to make, distribute,\nor use a product based on that documentation. For better or worse, patents\nplay a significant role in those activities. Although it does not prohibit\nanyone from patenting inventions embodied in an Open Hardware design, and\nof course cannot prevent a third party from enforcing their patent rights,\nthose who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that\ndesign infringes their patents or other intellectual property.\nThe OHL addresses unique issues involved in the creation of tangible,\nphysical things, but does not cover software, firmware, or code loaded\ninto programmable devices. A copyright-oriented license such as the GPL\nbetter suits these creations.\nHow can you use the OHL, or a design based upon it?
