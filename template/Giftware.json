It was created by a number of people working in cooperation, and is given to you\nfreely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like,\nand you do not have to give us anything in return.\nHowever, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro\ncommunity. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful bug report, making an\nimprovement to the library, or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that other people\ncan learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it would be nice\nif you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you\nnot to abuse our generosity.\nBy Shawn Hargreaves, 18 October 1998.\nDISCLAIMER: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND\nNON-INFRINGEMENT.
