It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library\nPublic License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By\ncontrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software\npackages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.\nYou can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the\nordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the\nexplanations below.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public\nLicenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\n(and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it;\nthat you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\nthat you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or\nto ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\nif you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\nrecipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and\nrecompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this\nlicense, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free\nlibrary. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will\nnot be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make\nsure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive\nlicense from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of\nthe library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This\nlicense, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite\ndifferent from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order\nto permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of\nthe two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria\nof freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the\nuser's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software\ndevelopers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason\nwe use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\nadvantages in certain special circumstances.\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a\ncertain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely\nused non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of\npeople to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its\nvariant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\nthat the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention\nto the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined\nwith the library in order to run.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be\nconveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to\nform executables.\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been\ndistributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the\nLibrary or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nLibrary or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\nto it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it\ncontains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\nthey are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted,\nand output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nLibrary (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).

Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the\napplication does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square\nroots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that\nwork are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and\nseparate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.
