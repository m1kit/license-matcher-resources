Stallman)\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not\nallowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\nThe license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast,\nour general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that\nyou get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you\nthese rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.\nSpecifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you\nreceive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it\nin new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\ntheir rights.\nAlso, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for\nNetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that\nwhat they have is not what we distributed.\nTherefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say\nwhat you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack.\nCOPYING POLICIES\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "1."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium,\nprovided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License\nAgreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a\ncopy of this License Agreement along with the program.\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "2."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nYou may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above (including distributing this License Agreement),\nprovided that you also do the following:\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "a)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\ncause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and\nthe date of any change; and\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "b)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\ncause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\nor is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all\nthird parties on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that\nyou may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties,\nat your option)\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "c)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nYou may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "3."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nYou may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in\nobject code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that\nyou also do one of the following:\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "a)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\naccompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\nthe terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "b)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\naccompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete machine-readable source\ncode from an appropriate archive site.
