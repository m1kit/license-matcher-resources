By contrast, our General\nPublic License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share\nand change free software--to make sure the software is free for\nall its users. The General Public License applies to the Free\nSoftware Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to\nmake sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\nof free software, that you receive source code or can get it if\nyou want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\nthat you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\ncan get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the\nsoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\ncertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\nthis free software. If the software is modified by someone else\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\nhave is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nFOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nThis License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may\nbe distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\nThe \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and\na \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nwork containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim\nor with modifications.
