It is\nnumbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies\nto some specially designated Free Software Foundation\nsoftware, and to any other libraries whose authors\ndecide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\nthe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we\ngave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you\nlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this\nfree library. If the library is modified by someone else and\npassed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have\nis not the original version, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing\nfree software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus\nin effect transforming the program into proprietary software.\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility\nprograms. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,\napplies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite\ndifferent from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't\nassume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is\nthat they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying\nor adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with\na library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply\nusing the library, and is analogous to running a utility program\nor application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the\nlinked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original\nlibrary, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended\nto permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to\nachieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved\nit as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The\nhope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\nand modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\nbetween a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses\nthe library\". The former contains code derived from the\nlibrary, while the latter only works together with the library.\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the\nordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this Library General Public License (also\ncalled \"this License\").

A \"work based on\nthe Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\nis included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. For a library, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains,\nplus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\nused to control compilation and installation of the library.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are\nnot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output\nfrom such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a\nwork based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\nin a tool for writing it).

Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function\nmust be optional: if the application does not supply it,\nthe square root function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
