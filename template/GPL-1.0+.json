By\ncontrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to\nthe Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\nit. You can use it for your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public\nLicense is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software\nor use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to\nask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must tell them their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which\ngives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that\nthere is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\non, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nThis License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the\ncopyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\nThe \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on\nthe Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of\nit, either verbatim or with modifications.
