For\nprogrammers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is\narguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used\nwherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.\nThis is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: The\ncase of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the\nrapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network\nmodels).\nWith the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the\ncontinued success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion of a few lines of\n\"GPL-tainted\" work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and\ngiven that further work will likely build upon the \"tainted\" portions, making them difficult\nto remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to\nprotect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such\n\"GPL-taint\".\nIn addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling (possibly\nclosed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.\nWhile under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license,\nif a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own\n(commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.\nFor the above reasons, we put forth this \"BSD Protection License\": A license designed to retain\nthe freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both\nnon-commercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that\nfreedom.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.\n"}]}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nBSD PROTECTION LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION\n"}, {"type": "optional", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "----------------------------------------------------------------"}]}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nDefinitions.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "a)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\"Program\", below, refers to any program or work distributed under the terms of this\nlicense.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "b)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nA \"work based on the Program\", below, refers to either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "c)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\"Modification\", below, refers to the act of creating derivative works.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "d)"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\"You\", below, refers to each licensee.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "1."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nScope.\nThis license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of the Program.
