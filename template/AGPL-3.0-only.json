By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended\nto guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\nprogram--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect\nyour rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the\nsoftware, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nA secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements\nmade in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread\nuse, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many\ndevelopers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the\nresulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network\nservers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public\nLicense permits making a modified version and letting the public access\nit on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically\nto ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes\navailable to the community. It requires the operator of a\nnetwork server to provide the source code of the modified version\nrunning there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use\nof a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives\nthe public access to the source code of the modified version.\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and published\nby Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different\nlicense, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new\nversion of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nDefinitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License.\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply\nto other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\nthis License.

The resulting work is called a \"modified\nversion\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified\nProgram or a work based on the Program.\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it\non a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\ncopying, distribution (with or without modification), making available\nto the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation\nthat enables other parties to make or receive copies.\nMere interaction with a user through a computer\nnetwork, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to\nthe extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey\nthe work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\nIf the interface presents a list of user commands or options,\nsuch as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "1."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nSource Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred\nform of the work for making modifications to it.\n\"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\nof interfaces specified for a particular programming language,\none that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form\nof packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.

It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and\na brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation, either\nversion 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\nof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSee the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License along with this program. If not, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a\ncomputer network, you should also make sure that it provides a\nway for users to get its source. For example, if your program is\na web application, its interface could display a \"Source\" link\nthat leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways\nyou could offer source, and different solutions will be better for\ndifferent programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\nor school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for\nthe program, if necessary.
