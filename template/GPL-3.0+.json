By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your\nfreedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all\nits users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our\nsoftware; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your\nprograms, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are\ndesigned to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the\nsoftware or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to\nsurrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to\nthe recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can\nget the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,\nand (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty\nfor this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified\nversions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of\nprevious versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside\nthem, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in\nthe area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If\nsuch problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to\nrestrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively\nproprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program\nnon-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "0."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nDefinitions.\n\u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such\nas semiconductor masks.\n\u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
