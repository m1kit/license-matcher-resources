Secondarily, this License preserves for the\nauthor and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while\nnot being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that\nderivative works of the document must themselves be free in\nthe same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,\nwhich is a copyleft license designed for free software.\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for\nfree software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "1."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nAPPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying\nit can be distributed under the terms of this License. The\n\"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any\nmember of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing\nthe Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or\nwith modifications and/or translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section\nof the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship\nof the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's\noverall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing\nthat could fall directly within that overall subject. (For\nexample, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,\na Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The\nrelationship could be a matter of historical connection with\nthe subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\nphilosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose\ntitles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the\nnotice that says that the Document is released under this License.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are\nlisted, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly\nand straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images\ncomposed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some\nwidely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input\nto text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of\nformats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an\notherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed\nto thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not\nTransparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include\nplain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX\ninput format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and\nstandard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.\nOpaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats\nthat can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,\nSGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are\nnot generally available, and the machine-generated HTML\nproduced by some word processors for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the\nmaterial this License requires to appear in the title page. For\nworks in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title\nPage\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the\nwork's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "2."}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nVERBATIM COPYING\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License.

Both covers must also clearly\nand legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The\nfront cover must present the full title with all words of the title\nequally prominent and visible.
