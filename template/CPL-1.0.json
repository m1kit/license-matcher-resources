While this license is intended to facilitate the\ncommercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other\nContributors.

The obligations in this section\ndo not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the\nCommercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\ncontrol, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related\nsettlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its\nown expense.\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.\nThat Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes\nperformance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\nwarranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone.
