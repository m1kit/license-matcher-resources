This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information\nSystems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development\nof this operating system. Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nProject MAC (1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence\nin the mid 1970s, under the leadership of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics\nprovided the best software architecture for managing computer hardware properly and for executing\nprograms. Many subsequent operating systems incorporated Multics principles. Multics was distributed\nin 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe, and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., as\nsuccessor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems\nInc.\n"}]}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n"}, {"type": "optional", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "\n.\n"}]}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "divider", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n"}], "pattern": "-*"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute these programs and their documentation for any purpose\nand without fee is hereby granted, provided that the below copyright notice and historical background\nappear in all copies and that both the copyright notice and historical background and this permission\nnotice appear in supporting documentation, and that the names of MIT, HIS, BULL or BULL HN not be used\nin advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the programs without specific prior written\npermission.\n"}, {"type": "var", "name": "copyright", "content": [{"type": "text", "content": "\nCopyright 1972 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Honeywell Information Systems Inc.\nCopyright 2006 by BULL HN Information Systems Inc.\nCopyright 2006 by Bull SAS All Rights Reserved\n"}], "pattern": ".{0,5000}"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n"}]
