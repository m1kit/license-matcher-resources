[{"tag": "text", "content": "\n"}, {"tag": "optional", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "\nOpen Data Commons Public Domain Dedication & License (PDDL)\n"}]}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nPreamble\nThe Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication & Licence is a document intended to allow you\nto freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This\nlicence is intended for use on databases or their contents (\"data\"), either together\nor individually.\nMany databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, have specific special\nrights that cover databases called the \"sui generis\" database right. Both of these sets of\nrights, as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or\npractical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a\nlimited amount of rights under a \"some rights reserved\" approach to licensing as outlined in\nthe Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver and licence\ntries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database\nand data. Any Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part\nof this document, and do not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or\ndata.\nThe position of the recipient of the work\nBecause this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public\ndomain, there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document. Recipients\nmay use this work commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database with\nother databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them secret. It is not a\nrequirement that recipients provide further users with a copy of this licence or attribute the\noriginal creator of the data or database as a source. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by\nthe original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others.\nThe position of the dedicator of the work\nCopyright law, as with most other law under the banner of \"intellectual property\", is\ninherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other\nIP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This\nis despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication\ntechnologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a\ndocument relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database\nrights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this\ndocument first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to\nlicense these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish\nor waive rights or claims.\nThe purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain.\nUnlike licences for free and open source software, free cultural works, or open content licences,\nrightsholders will not be able to \"dual license\" their work by releasing the same work under\ndifferent licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they\nchoose. Rightsholders therefore can\u2019t re-license it under copyright or database rights on\ndifferent terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to\nbuild rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts.\nThis document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the data). Because databases can\nhave a wide variety of content - not just factual data - rightsholders should use the Open Data\nCommons - Public Domain Dedication & Licence for an entire database and its contents only if\neverything can be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes\nhave intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this licence to cover both the database\nand its factual data when making material available under this document; even if it is likely that the\ndata would not be covered by copyright or database rights.\nRightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a\ndatabase, and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do this\nbecause this document refers to the \"Work\", which can be either - or both - the database and\nits contents. As a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this\ndocument when they dedicate it.\nJust like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware\nthat one can only license what one owns. Please ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this\nmaterial available under this document.\nThis document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available to the public for any use of any kind,\nand it should not be used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen.\nPart I: Introduction\nThe Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims over the Work) agrees as follows:\n"}, {"tag": "var", "name": "bullet", "content": [{"tag": "text", "content": "1.0"}], "pattern": ".{0,20}"}, {"tag": "text", "content": "\nDefinitions of Capitalised Words\n\"Copyright\" - Includes rights under copyright and under neighbouring rights and\nsimilarly related sets of rights under the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\n6.4.\n\"Data\" - The contents of the Database, which includes the information, independent\nworks, or other material collected into the Database offered under the terms of this\nDocument.\n\"Database\" - A collection of Data arranged in a systematic or methodical way and\nindividually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this\nDocument.\n\"Database Right\" - Means rights over Data resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui\ngeneris\") rights in the Database Directive (Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases) and any future\nupdates as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section\n6.4.\n\"Document\" - means this relinquishment and waiver of rights and claims and back up\nlicence agreement.\n\"Person\" - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.\n\"Use\" - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by Copyright or Database\nRights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes modifying the Work as may be\ntechnically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.
