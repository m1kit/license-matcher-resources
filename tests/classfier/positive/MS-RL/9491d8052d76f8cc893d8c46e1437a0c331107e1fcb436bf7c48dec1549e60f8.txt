          Definitions
             
The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works,"
                 and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.

           
A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.

             
A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.

             
"Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its
             contribution.
