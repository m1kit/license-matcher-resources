          Definitions
             
The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works,"
                 and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law. A
                 "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the
                 software. A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution
                 under this license. "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent
                 claims that read directly on its contribution.
