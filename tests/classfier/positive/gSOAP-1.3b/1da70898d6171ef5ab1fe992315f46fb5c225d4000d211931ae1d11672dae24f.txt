You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the

                         case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                         Covered Code.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
                 or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
                 comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
                 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
                 described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

                 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
                         always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
                         such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
                         apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must
                         (a) rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any confusingly
                         similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that you license differs
                         from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
                         contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the
                         Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
