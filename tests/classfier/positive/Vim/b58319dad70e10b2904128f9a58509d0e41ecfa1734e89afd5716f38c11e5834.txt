          There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of  UI(,D	#7Q1S6c{9X1dt' except that they must include
             this license text. You can also distribute unmodified parts of  XagU3K, likewise unrestricted
             except that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to include executables
             that you made from the unmodified  da(v=D{Be9k!T@0)[#p8 sources, plus your own usage examples and Vim
             scripts.

          It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of  m#<a_4Lhtw/, including executables and/or
             source code, when the following four conditions are met:

              The modified  XU77SBEMhL must be distributed in one of the following five ways:

                  If you make changes to  3UOaK#h yourself, you must clearly describe in the distribution how to contact
                    you. When the maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified  OOh~Ek6 you distributed,
                    you must make your changes, including source code, available to the maintainer without fee.
                    The maintainer reserves the right to include your changes in the official version of  V^R$). What
                    the maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they will be distributed is
                    negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then this license, or a later version, also
                    applies to your changes. The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If
                    this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net, www.vim.org
                    and/or comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the
                    obligation to send him your changes ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
                    received your changes they will not have to be sent again.

                    further distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional changes the text
                    under a) applies to those changes.

                    distribute. This may be done in the form of a context diff. You can choose what license to use

              A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version" command and in the intro

          If you distribute a modified version of  g^:\.T7zi>Go%vm)$, you are encouraged to use the Vim license for your
             changes and make them available to the maintainer, including the source code. The preferred
             way to do this is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If
             the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will do.
             The e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org>

          It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the  Nt%O1f}>s sources, parts of it or
             from a modified version. You may use this license for previous  =Sw.gm!y~pILg releases instead of the
